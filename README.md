- Create an account/sign in with your own Win Jar Account
- Google SSO

## Future improvements üîÆ
### Features
- The user can edit wins
- The user can 'lock' their win jar access - so they can add wins but only open it on a certain date (e.g. New Year, anniversary, X months in the future)
- The user can set reminders to add a win (help with habit building)
- The user can have multiple jars for different contexts (e.g personal, work)
- Users can have shared win jars (e.g. for teams, families, friends)
- The user can share wins to socials e.g. Twitter after adding them
- The user can view statistics about their wins (e.g. win streak (like habit tracking))
- The dashboard displays a random win from the past (like Facebook memories, 'hey remember this? go you!!')
- The user can select and export their wins in a format that can be shared - (e.g. might be useful in a work setting when it comes to performance appraisals so you can share with your manager)
- The user can search through their wins
- The wins can be assigned tags
- The user can filter their wins by certain parameters e.g. date, tags
- Allow user to have and update profile and have personalisation in UI, e.g. 'Hello {FIRST_NAME}'

### Technical / Project
- Disable 'add win' if there is no text input
- Add interaction/code tests with Playwright/Jest
- Fix Google SSO sign in redirects
- Customise Amplify Authenticator to match app styling
- Have a dedicated landing page with more info about the product and where they can click to go through to a dedicated signup / sign-in page or modal
